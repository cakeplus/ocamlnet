Constant workload manager:

	Do not use param "jobs" but "threads" to specifiy the number of 
	threads. (Bg: Multiplexed services can have more jobs than threads.)

protocol.path:

	Create directories as needed

Http_client.pipeline:
	
	method event_system

	reset() does not work properly

rpc_factory:

	Pass hook functions in

Command line options of netplex:

	Possibility to set default values to different things

Container:

	[lookup] returns the wrong sockets

	log messages in pre_finish_hook do not reach the logger!

Arch:

	Avoid name service hacks

Shutdown:

	does not work if components open TCP conns to themselves.

	Killing the master process should forward the signal to the
	children.

	rpc_factory: shutdown should at least shut down the rpc server
	
Fix:
	In Netplex_controller.controller_processor#process:
	proc_send_admin_message calls forward_message instead of
	forward_admin_message
