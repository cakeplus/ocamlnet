Things to do + roadmap
----------------------------------------------------------------------

TESTS:
	- Netplex_cenv
	- searcher
	- examples


Overall:
	- Concept for signals
	  Sched: after 2.2.0 is out

	- Pluggable name service (for hosts, at least)
	  Sched: 2.3

Feature request:
	- netclient: Support for CONNECT
	  Sched: 2.3

	- Nethttp.Header.get_set_cookie
	  Sched: after 2.2.0 is out
	   (see get-set-cookie.ml)	   

Equeue:
	- Fix command engines as commented in the code.
	  Sched: after 2.2.0 is out

	Syntax for engine concatenation?
   	- when_state style:
  	  eng1 >> (function Success _ -> | Error _ -> | ...)
	- ...

Netplex:
	- Make the container easily accessible: Netplex_container.get_current.
	  Implementation is actually in Netplex_mp and Netplex_mt.

	- Move accepted() from Control to System? Implement totally different
	  mechanisms?

	- Enhanced logging. Also allow non-error channels.
	  Sched: 2.3

	- 2-phase shutdown
	  ("announce" callback)
	  Sched: after 2.2.0 is out	

	- Netplex_main.startup: Option [ctrl_initializer : controller -> unit]
	  to allow initialization of the controller right after it has been
          created, and before services are added.

	- Bug: Netplex_controller's alive_check isn't stopped when the
 	  controller is shut down

	- Bug: daemonization doesn't wait until the inner process is
	  initialized (enough)

Integration of new netcgi2
	- All the TODOs in Netcgi_common
	  Sched: after 2.2.0 is out

	- Test nethttpd when linked with netcgi2
	- Move new cookie implementation to Nethttp, and make it a 
	  class
	  Sched: 2.3

	- Faster URL encoding functions can be moved to Netencoding
	  if really faster
	  Sched: 2.3

netcgi2-plex:
	- Implement mount_dir/mount_at
	  Sched: 2.3

RPC:
	- Exceptions from client callbacks are suppressed by default:
	  (1) Default handler re-raises exception
	  (2) Allow the handler to re-raise exception

Bugs Tidalwave:
  * ocamlnet
	- Bug: Netstring_pcre.global_replace
	  Sched: after 2.2.0 is out

	- Feature Netgzip hinzu
	  Sched: 2.3

Http_client.pipeline:

	- CHECK: Assert_failure Http_client line 1870
	  A possible cause has been fixed. Check whether this holds.
	
	- aggressive caching does not work properly. Sometimes descriptors
	  are closed in the wrong moment.
	  Sched: 2.3

Shell_uq:
	- Double close von stderr-Descriptor falls in when_done eine
          exception geworfen wird

Later:
	- Use poll() instead of select() to overcome fdset limitations
	  Sched: 2.3
