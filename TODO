----------------------------------------------------------------------

Shell.command:
 - inherit_descriptors:bool
   If true, no additional attempt is made to close descriptors, and only the
   descriptors with close-on-exec flag are closed.
 - Impl: Do not pass Fda_close_except to spawn

add support options to docs
 - List of possible features to implement

- Optimization Netmcore_heap.add_immutable:
  If a pointer into the target heap is found, the data pointed to is
  not copied. Benefit: Immutable data structures (Set, Map)
  USER: plasma, Nn_notify

Netnumber plus add, sub

Netplex_controller: better data structure for connection list

Since Vista there is WSAPoll. Support it?

Http_client:
 - Option to limit the total number of concurrent connections
 - Report to the user:
    * whether more requests would be acceptable in general
      pipeline # can_open_more_connections
    * whether a certain request would be ok:
      pipeline # queue_length_for : http_call -> int
      returns the number of calls in this queue

docs: Depict mem architecture of netmcore (multiple heaps, pool)

fix reported problems

- Equeue_ssl: include function to extract cert fingerprint

- Bug Http_client:
  Digest auth where the server uses a domain string with several URLs!
  e.g. domain="/path http://server/path" (legal according to RFC).
  Symptom: The authenticated request is not tried at all after getting
  the 401 response

- bug netcgi2-apache:
  add -Wl,--rpath,$(APACHE_OCAMLLIBDIR) to $(APXS) for builing the .so
  the --rpath option is platform-dependent, though

- Reverse proxy for Nethttpd

- ephemeral bug in Netplex: when the container shuts down, the controller
  may log a crit error EPIPE. This is not critical, though. Better:
  The container announces the shutdown, and the controller shuts its
  servers down at this moment.

- Rpc_server.auth_limit (m:auth_method) ...:
  limits authentication to certain programs/versions/procedures
- Rpc_server.name_auth_method (n:name) (m:auth_method)
  sets the name of the method

- Netplex:
  * Easier way to catch controller termination
    Netplex_cenv.on_system_shutdown
    (can use a plugin internally for the controller case) UNCLEAR
  * container # once f: The function f is only run once per socket service

- Nethttpd should respect Netcgi.*.default_exn_handler
  * Need more information
  * What would be the meaning of disabling default_exn_handler
    in (cgi-)config?
  * maybe it is just about unifying the two styles of error pages?
    (Nethttpd_util.std_error_response vs. Netcgi_common.error_page)

- GSS-API for HTTP: see RFC 4559. This is specified for SPNEGO
  and NTLM, but looks applicable to any other mechanism, too

- add utility functions for password hashing
  (see /etc/passwd under Linux)

***

- RPC: support relaying specially: if a server simply wants to forward
  an RPC call unchanged to a different port, there is no need to decode
  the message fully.

Netstring:
 - add "parse_ls_l"
 - Ftp_fs: use parser for the output of "LIST" when there is no MLST command

Netmulticore:
 - type heap_descr - DONE
 - *_descr for each data structure - DONE
 - heap: be more careful with GC colors
 - heap: support r/w locks
 - heap: support recursive locks for modify
 - heap: allow custom ints
 - heap: helper function self_contained
 - Netmcore_buffer.gc: remove all unreferenced mem blocks
 - Netmcore_hashtbl.gc: shrink the table as far as possible
 - Netmcore_mutex: also provide crash-resilient type of mutex

Examples:
 - pipeline - DONE
 - nqueens - DONE
 - matrix
 - sort

Docs:
 - Multicore tutorial - DONE
 - Multicore memory management (background info)

Blogs:
 - Multicore announcement + test release - DONE
 - N-Queens - DONE
 - Pipeline
 - Matrix


IDEAS FOR OCAMLNET RECIPES:
 - How to maintain a set of cookies on the client side


Enhanced stream_fs:
 - read_file - DONE
 - write_file - DONE
 - metadata operations: ???
 - problem with normal write: how to signal that the operation is
   aborted?
   * abort_write method - DONE (cancel)

Enhanced token scanner:
  Mimestring.create_mime_scanner: Support further options:
   - Enable_comments / Disable_comments -> (, ) can be part of atoms
   - Enable_qstrings / Disable_qstrings -> "" can be part of atoms
   - Enable_domaintoken / Disable_domaintoken -> [ ] can be part of atoms
  New optional arguments:
    ~profile:`Null if true, comments, qstrings, domaintokens are disabled
     except explicitly enabled
    ~profile:`Email for traditional settgins
  Also, there should be a new kind of token, Delimited, with
   - Delimited(start_char, text, end_char)
     e.g. Delimited('<', url, '>')
  Delimited needs to be configured:
   - Delimited_tokens(start_char, end_char, forbidden_chars)
     e.g. Delimited_tokens('<', '>', [' '])

  Even better idea:
   - highly configurable scanner Netscan

- Http: factor streaming access functions out

- Neturl: internationalized URLs
  RFC 3492

- continue netmulticore

- Finishing pluggable DNS resolver
  * new iml Uq_engines.direct_socket_connector
  * Http_client - HALF DONE
    + open: Use Uq_resolver also in the async case
  * Telnet_client - DONE
  * Uq_socks5: - HALF DONE
    + open: Use Uq_resolver in an async way
  * raise Host_not_found if lookups fail! - DONE. We are now using
    Uq_resolver in Uq_engines.connector.
  * Set IPv6 prefs in Uq_resolver - DONE
  * integrate netdns
  * IPv6 for netdns

- FTP w/SSL support
  * RFC 4217
  * SSL for data channels: currently, the data connections use
    Uq_engines.sender/receiver to copy data from a file_descr to
    an async_in/out_channel:
      descr --copy--> async_in/out_channel.
    Change this to:
      descr --wrap--> mplex --copy--> async_in/out_channel
    Do the copy with Uq_io.copy.
  * SSL for control channel: Need to upgrade Telnet_client so it
    can use (and exchange) mplex.
    Difficulty: OOB data cannot be routed via mplex.
  * Support for AUTH, PROT, PBSZ
    - AUTH: Once we get a positive response, switch to SSL on the
      control connection
    - remember in ftp_state what was negotiated for the data conn.
      Enable SSL if privacy is requested. Attn: always use tls_connect,
      even if an active mode file transfer is being done!
  * Modularity:
    - Add concept of "security_provider", an implementation-dependent
      type
    - By pushing the AUTH_SSL provider, this security mechanism becomes
      available.
  * test against: e.g. pureftpd
  * dev time: 1 day

Netstring_pcre.replace: The replacement string follows PCRE syntax
(i.e. $& for whole match etc.) - FIXED

Netnumber (in netstring): - DONE
 - defines all the numeric Rtypes - DONE
 - plus comparisons - DONE
 - submodule BE (big endian) - DONE
 - submodule LE (little endian) - DONE

- WebDAV, Haddop_fs: use Netfs.empty_fs - DONE
- Netfs.abort_write - DONE (cancel)

Fixme:
 - Netstring_pcre.quote: does not work for NULL bytes - DONE

- export Netcgi_common.error_page - DONE
- Netmcore_mempool.shm_name_of_pool - DONE
- Http_fs: the http_stream_fs should also define a pipeline method - DONE
- Http_fs: enable compression if possible - DONE

- Uq_engines.signal_engine: should be thread-safe (signal function
  can be called from other thread) - DONE
- Http_client.pipeline: add requests via an engine - DONE

- IPv6 list:
  netcgi2: Netcgi_common, class cgi: prep of properties searches
  for ':' in SERVER_NAME. This won't work anymore. - DONE

  * Netplex_cenv.container_count : service_name -> int
    (useful in pre_start_hook, post_finish_hook) - DONE (as container meth)
  * container # is_first : bool - WONT
  * make startup_directory accessible in containers - DONE
  * socket_directory should be an absolute path - DONE

- RPc_server: preflight mode for XDR - 
  DONE (array length check)

- Better exceptions: connect_check should include the socket address
  as third string - DONE
- Netplex: startup_directory: make this also visible in container - DONE
- LIne number in errors like
  Netplex_config.Config_error("./twincastd.conf: Syntax error") - DONE

- Bug Http_client:
  OPTIONS with authentication does not work!
  Symptom: request fails with `No_reply status.
  Problem: OPTIONS is not idempotent. So
   - after first attempt: the request is checked, and as a result it is
     re-added to fragile_pipeline
     (and implicitly reinitialized)
   - server closes connection
   - robust pipeline: finds the fresh request, but does not reschedule
     it because a second check is done, and it is found that the request is
     not idempotent
  Solution: When the request is added by authentication the second
  check in robust_pipeline must be skipped. Add a flag to message class
  to remember the decision of the first check
  - DONE

Optimization:
  - Uq_io.input_lines: reads as much lines as possible from in_buffer
    and returns list of lines
    -> useful in Mapred_task_exec, emap implementation
    DONE

- Finish Neturl (~addr, ~socksymbol, url_addr, url_socksymbol) - DONE
- Uq_resolver: support IP addresses enclosed in brackets - DONE

inject custom esys into Netplex
- DONE

Idea. If -debug Netlog.ms/us/ns log with higher precision
  (Also for Netplex)
- DONE VIA NEW FORMAT STRINGS

Fix Uq_io.read for Plasma
 - WONT

- speed up accepts in Netplex
  DONE

- Netchannels.lift_in: if buffered=false, automatically enable the
  buffer the first time input_line is called
  WONT

- Performance: after lift_in, the input_line fn is slow
  DONE: Not exactly sure what this is. Added a new option ~pass_through
  which makes it easier to use a buffer on demand only

Advanced:
 - Special form of condition variables one can poll on
   (See Plasma: pfs_condition) - DONE

- Netshm: use blitting functions encoded in C (for int32 bigarrays)
  Better: bigarray conversion to flat memory
  DONE

Make Netplex containers thread-safe
- DONE

Generalize the following for engines:
 - Uq_engines.Thread_monitor
   val create : esys -> mon
   val run : mon -> (esys -> 'a -> 'b engine) -> esys -> 'a -> 'b engine

   [let e = run mon f esys arg]: Semantically, this just calls [f arg]
   and returns the result as engine [e]. The specialty of the
   thread monitor is that the [run] function can be called from
   several threads in parallel. It is ensured that all functions [f]
   that are running at the same time are all running in the same
   thread. The monitor is allowed to switch to a different thread
   when any of the functions [f] finishes. Switching can happen
   whenever the event system waits for new events.
DONE

Unixqueue: if the loop is left by exception, ensure that the pollset
is disposed - DONE

inet addr functions from Plasma_util - DONE

netmcore pools: option to initialize the pool (avoid SIGBUS)
- DONE


- Fix Netmcore, when forking:
  do not unmap anymore if a mapping is not inherited (or make this
  configurable)
  DONE (default is now to inherit all resources)

- Fix Netmcore:
  get_resource should do all the process and resource table cleanup
  from post_start when it is called the first time in container
  context. This way the cleanup is also done when a process uses
  the machinery that was not started via Netmcore. - DONE

RPC marshalling speedup
 - DONE

- Implement Netsys_posix.spawn with posix_spawn for systems 
  supporting that - DONE

- Improve Rtypes performance - DONE

- RPC: generate direct mapping - DONE

  other threads - DONE

- Name_resolution_error
  use this in Uq_engines.connector. - DONE

- Netclient: Support for CONNECT - DONE

- Netclient: Code-cleanup - DONE

- Netclient: engine interface for HTTP - DONE

- access to good random number generator on all platforms
  (for cryptogrpahy) - DONE

- GSSAPI - DONE

  * RPC - DONE
  * Http_client - DONE

- pluggable filesystem classes - DONE

Bugs Tidalwave:
  * ocamlnet
	- Bug: Netstring_pcre.global_replace - DONE

Http_client.pipeline:
	- aggressive caching does not work properly. Sometimes descriptors
	  are closed in the wrong moment. - DONE



----------------------------------------------------------------------
Plan for Ocamlnet 3
----------------------------------------------------------------------

--- Already done:

  * Netclient: better storage methods. Pass status code (or even header)
    to the `File or `Body function. DONE

- Doc:
  * container sockets - DONE

- Other
  * Go through examples. Fix programming style
      nethttpd DONE
      rpc/finder DONE


  * check Uq_engines.poll_process_engine
  * add Util.connector_of_sockaddr to Rpc_client
  * move signal_engine, rpc_engine to Ocamlnet
  * functions for creating Netplex_types.protocol and .socket_service_config
  * Rpc_util: function for printing arbitrary values
    (use: Nn_state, Transaction_error)
  * Rpc_client: ensure that first error is properly reported
    (instead of Message_lost)
  * bug sigchld_process: should check all processes (signals can be
    merged)

  * Rpc_proxy: layer on top of Rpc_client w/ automatic connection handling
  * Generate proxies
  * Rpc trace
  * Fix: `Accept_limit_length for Rpc_server. Add filters to clients, too
    (see msg by rafaelsen on ocamlnet-devel)
  * Bug Paolo Donadeo on ocamlnet-devel:
    `Redirect_response not working
  * Redesign Win32 named pipe support. Interface resembles socket API.
  * Security aspects of Win32 named pipes
  * Fully integrate named pipes into Unixqueue and Netplex
  * Limited support for anonymous pipes using helper threads
    (Netsys_win32: I/O threads; also support these whereever reasonable)
  * Support for something similar to Netsys_posix.spawn
  * Integrate win32 spawn into Shell
  * netplex: socket directory is ignored for Unix domain sockets.
    relative UD sockets should be taken relative to socket dir
  * netplex_main:
      - chdir for daemonize
  * netplex: Shut down master sockets after use.
  * netplex.fd_table: print fd table from Netlog
  * netclient: Set "Host" header also for proxy requests
  * netclient: parsing fails of URL http://host?param
  * nethtml: <body> is now an essential block
  * netcgi2, url: better magic to enfore '/' between script name and path info
  * Container-private servers. Containers may define additional RPC
    servers for local data traffic only. (-> address type "container")
  * think about page pools, for cases where too many pages are mmap'ed.
    Generalization of the free pages we manage in Netpagebuffer.
  * Netdate: support for RFC 3339 dates (see webdav_xml)
  * ocamlrpcgen: export _program variable in client interfaces
  * Rpc_netplex: config var for Rpc_server.set_timeout
  * RPC: prevent that xid's can be reused
  * new netplex admin command: netplex.connections. The detail string
    is implemented for RPC only, so far.
  * Documentation: What is supported on Win32?
  * nethttpd_services: GET /file//path?p=1
    parameters like p were not recognized when there was "//" in path
    (redirect_request bug)
  * nethttpd_services: if PATH_TRANSLATED points to a directory, omit the
    trailing slash. See also Nethtttpd_services.w32_fix_trailing_slash -
    but this is a hack
  * Nethttpd: configurable error response
  * Nethttpd: option for suppressing "broken pipe"
  * Gprof support
  * "syslog": Just calls syslog()


- object strings:
  class type string =
    object
      method length : int
      method string : string
      method memory : memory
      method blit_to_string : ...
      method blit_to_memory : ...
    end

  Use this in RPC context to avoid copying of strings as much as possible.
  Option for the user to see these objects:
  typedef _object string mystring<>;

- NetCGI cleanup - DONE

- Shell_uq/Shell_sys: Drop Shell_sys.wait implementation. Replace with
  engine. The system_handler is replaced by something like
  type system_handler = {
     mutable eng_opt : engine opt;
       (* The engine. abort stops it. run runs it *)
     watch_descriptors : Unix.file_descr list -> Unix.file_descr list -> unit
       (* Set the descriptors to watch *)
  }

  * Shell for POSIX systems: fix the style how ocamlnet waits for 
    forked processes. The current solution does not work well for
    mt programs because it is undefined which thread gets the SIGCHLD.
      - ocamlnet-3.0test1 has had some issues here. These are now fixed.

  * Netplex:
      - set logger earlier (if external logger is used): Now using Netlog.

- fd leaks / double close:
  * Netlog: implements hash table with used descriptors (in debugging
    mode)
    - for each managed fd:
        - owning module
        - type
        - GC hook: pointer to a finalisable block. When this block is collected
          the fd is set to state "garbage
    - which fd's to manage: the long-living fd's


- Move new cookie implementation to Nethttp - DONE

- Faster URL encoding functions can be moved to Netencoding
  if really faster - REVISIT

- Bug: Netplex daemonization doesn't wait until the inner process is
  initialized (enough)

- Better Bigarray integration:
  * read/write with bigarray as buffer

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Performance improvements after Ocamlnet 3.0
----------------------------------------------------------------------

A list of possible improvements, once interfaces are stable again:

- Provide epoll/kqueue-based event_system
  * epoll - DONE

- Implement Netplex_semaphore with POSIX semaphores for systems
  supporting them
  --> Do this when we have pollable semaphores!

   * pollable semaphores: emulate with pipes
     post : lock
            n = getvalue
            post
            if n=0 then write(pipe)
            unlock
     trywait : lock
            if trywait then
              n = getvalue
              if n=0 then read(pipe)
            else error
            unlock
     async_wait:
            poll for pipe(read)
            if readable then
              trywait

     Unix implementation (Netsys_psem, Uq_psem):
      - one named sem for lock
      - one names sem for sem
      - one named pipe for pipe
      - Linux: use eventfd instead of pipe

- Implement Netplex_sharedvar with Netshm shared memory for systems
  supporting that

- RPC: server should support caching for configured procedures
  (Hmmm, unclear. Maybe we just want a server where one can intercept the
  raw messages.)

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Implementation improvements after Ocamlnet 3.0
----------------------------------------------------------------------

- NNTP client implementation (async)

- signalfd (Linux), as an efficient way of catching SIGCHLD

- Update Equeue_intro:
   * Throw out the chapter about async channel
   * Include a chapter about Uq_io

- Rpc_proxy: 
  * revise shared reliability caches.
  * idempotent calls: better the endpoint is immediately switched after
    the first failure

- Configurable async name resolution (already started: Uq_resolver)
  [Maybe include netdns?]

- Cluster Message bus (netfunk)

- Improved shared memory support; RPC over shared memory
  [Depends very much on whether camlboxes can be made safer, and
   can be more easily integrated with equeue)

- Fix netplex + nethttpd + async API: netcgi cannot be used right now
  * Cheap impl.: uploaded data is always stored as file or in mem;
    generated data, too; make esys available in environment
  * Better impl: provide clean engine API in Nethttpd_engines
    (or new module Nethttpd_async_service)

- krb5 for rpc

- netplex component for monitoring:
   - ping RPC services, but also support for plugging in other protocols
   - post monitoring results to neighbors (UDP, optionally with multicasting)

- Fix ocamldoc warnings

- delegation classes for Netmime

- Fix Netplex_kit.start_helper_thread so that the component leaves
  `Starting state quickly

- Bug Win32 and netplex-admin -shutdown: Apparently, the sys client
  is not shut down, and the sys server keeps going because of this.
  There is a pipe_shutdown call for the sys client, but it does not seem
  to do what it is supposed to. Result is that the shutdown hangs.

- Rpc_server:
   * support suspended state
   * in suspended state, the server is no longer reading new serialized
     calls. It is still emitting responses, though.
   * Rpc_server.suspend_on [ `Always | `Num_unresponded_calls of int
                           | `Num_connections of int ]
   * extended check for validity of messages


----------------------------------------------------------------------
Further ideas
----------------------------------------------------------------------

- camlboxes:
  * safer. E.g. detect when there are pointers to camlbox messages,
    and prevent then that the message can be freed
  * generic copy function that copies messages to the normal heap - DONE
  * support for bigarrays, int32 etc. The custom_ops need to be
    put into the camlbox by the receiver process - DONE
  * more flexible memory management, e.g. support messages with
    dynamic size

- ocamlrpcgen:
   * immutable records
   ...

- input/output channels with the possibility of intercepting
  (e.g. progress bars). Also for MIME bodies

- netconversion: support UTF-8 byte order marks

- netconversion: support for character case

- netconversion: support for Unicode db (implement normalization forms)
  * saslprep

- netbuffer: more search functions. Substring search. Maybe even globbing

- netdate: sanity checking (is the date valid)
  Optionally restrict Netdate.parse to certain patterns

  more calendar functions? Compat with calendar library?

- Nethttp.Header:
   missing: set_cookie_ct, get_set_cookie_ct

- implement cookie jar, optionally use it in http_client

- Focus RPC:
  * Rpc_server: Allow to set timeout for the server response itself
    (self-watching)
  * Annotations
  * Sandbox mode for decoding messages. In a first pass it is checked
    whether array and string sizes are all good (before allocating mem)

- Focus Win32:

  * CHECK: Call CancelIo to cancel the overlapped I/O requests when
    the pipe struct is freed?

- Focus Netplex:
  * Revisit: helper containers for multi-processing. Make it easy to
    define a template at system startup time, and to instantiate it
    later at any time

  * Message passing between containers: Containers can define a 
    message queue, and other containers can send XDR-able messages.
    Queues are referenced by a global naming scheme.

    OR: Netplex_queue. Ops:
     - add, also with max
     - take
     - wait until n>0
     - wait until n<N
     - "wait": also as async op
     - msg encoding: as for Netplex_sharedvar

  * Revisit: Netplex + UDP

- mmap memory:
  * also support for mprotect
  * Netsys_mem support also for other protocol interpreters than RPC

- Log of deprecated functions (Netlog). Enabled by default.

- "syslog_emulation": The syslog protocol itself

- Nethttpd + SSL: This could be made working by establishing another
  file descriptor abstraction

  class type layered_socket =
  object
    method read : string -> int -> int -> int
      (* EAGAIN in the blocking case *)

    method write : string -> int -> int -> int

    method shutdown : unit -> unit
      (* EAGAIN in the blocking case *)

    method block : [`Read|`Write|`Write_eof|`Shutdown] list -> tmo:float -> [`Read|`Write|`Write_eof|`Shutdown] list
      (* Blocks until one of these ops becomes possible, and indicates
         which. There is no guarantee, however - if a following [read]
         or [write] ends with [EAGAIN], one has to [block] again.
      *)	

    method translate : [`Read|`Write|`Write_eof|`Shutdown] list -> [`Read|`Write] list
      (* Translates a high-level I/O condition to a descriptor-level r/w
         condition. The argument says what the user waits upon: read
         and/or write. The return value says how to watch the file descriptor.
         The return value may depend on the internal state of the protocol
         engine.

         For non-blocking I/O, one should first translate the user
         request, wait until the fd is in one of the indicated states,
         then call read/write. If this results in [EAGAIN], the whole
         sequence is to be repeated.
       *)

    method fd : Unix.file_descr
    method inactivate : unit -> unit
  end

- Netplex + RPC + SSL: should be easy to configure

- support for CPS transformations

- async local file I/O
