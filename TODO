Performance improvements
----------------------------------------------------------------------

A list of possible improvements, once interfaces are stable again:

- Provide epoll/kqueue-based event_system

- Implement Netplex_semaphore with POSIX semaphores for systems
  supporting them

- Implement Netplex_sharedvar with Netshm shared memory for systems
  supporting that

- Implement Netsys_posix.spawn with posix_spawn for systems 
  supporting that

Things to do + roadmap
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Unix.select => poll:
	- nethttpd_kernel: Still uses select
	- netcgi1/jserv: Still uses select (just document, won't fix)

TESTS:
	- Netplex_cenv
	- searcher
	- examples


Overall:
	- Pluggable name service (for hosts, at least)
	  Sched: 2.3

Feature request:
	- netclient: Support for CONNECT
	  Sched: 2.3

Equeue:
	- Fix command engines as commented in the code.
	  Sched: after 2.2.0 is out

	- Uq_engines.connector: currently raises Not_found for a name
	  resolution error. Do something better.

	Syntax for engine concatenation?
   	- when_state style:
  	  eng1 >> (function Success _ -> | Error _ -> | ...)
	- ...

Netplex:
	- Move accepted() from Control to System? Implement totally different
	  mechanisms?

	- Netplex_main.startup: Option [ctrl_initializer : controller -> unit]
	  to allow initialization of the controller right after it has been
          created, and before services are added.

	- Bug: daemonization doesn't wait until the inner process is
	  initialized (enough)

Integration of new netcgi2
	- All the TODOs in Netcgi_common
	  Sched: after 2.2.0 is out

	- Test nethttpd when linked with netcgi2
	- Move new cookie implementation to Nethttp, and make it a 
	  class
	  Sched: 2.3

	- Faster URL encoding functions can be moved to Netencoding
	  if really faster
	  Sched: 2.3

netcgi2-plex:
	- Implement mount_dir/mount_at
	  Sched: 2.3

RPC:
	- Exceptions from client callbacks are suppressed by default:
	  (1) Default handler re-raises exception
	  (2) Allow the handler to re-raise exception

Bugs Tidalwave:
  * ocamlnet
	- Bug: Netstring_pcre.global_replace
	  Sched: after 2.2.0 is out

	- Feature Netgzip hinzu
	  Sched: 2.3

Http_client.pipeline:
	- aggressive caching does not work properly. Sometimes descriptors
	  are closed in the wrong moment.
	  Sched: 2.3

Shell_uq:
	- Double close von stderr-Descriptor falls in when_done eine
          exception geworfen wird
