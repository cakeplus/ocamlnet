Examples for Netcamlbox
======================================================================

Compile with "make all". Only native-code executables are created
(the idea of camlboxes is to maximize performance).

speed:
    This example creates two processes, and one of these sends N
    short messages to the other, using camlboxes as transport medium.

    This is also a good introductory example. Many explanatory comments
    have been added.

manymult:
    This is about speeding up matrixmultiplication on multicores.
    n_workers worker processes are created, and each worker process
    has a camlbox where it waits for new matrices to multiply. 
    The master process also has a camlbox where it receives the
    computed result matrices.

unimult:
    Sequential matrix multiplication, for comparison with manymult.
