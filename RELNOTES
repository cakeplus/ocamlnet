Intro
----------------------------------------------------------------------

These are release notes for ocamlnet-2.2test12. This version of
ocamlnet is a preview release. Developers interested in the upcoming
2.2 version can have look at it, and experienced developers are
invited to test it, and to help finding the remaining bugs and
problems.

In general, the stability of this version is already excellent.
About 90 % of the code has been taken over from previous versions
of ocamlnet, equeue, netclient, and rpc, and this means that this
code is already mature. About 10 % of the code has been newly
developed:

- netcgi2 is a revised version of the cgi library. Large parts
  are completely new. The stability is unclear yet.

- netplex is the new server framework. Fortunately, it could already
  be used in a production environment, and it has proven excellent
  stability there.

- netcgi2-plex combines netcgi2 and netplex. Stability is unclear.

- nethttpd has now the option to use netcgi2 as cgi provider
  (configure option -prefer-netcgi2). This is mostly untested.

- netshm adds shared memory support. The stability is unclear
  yet.

- equeue-ssl and rpc-ssl add SSL support to the RPC libraries.
  Stability is unclear.

The project would profit most if these libraries were tested by
independent developers.

Known Problems
----------------------------------------------------------------------

There are known problems in this preview release:

- There is no good concept to manage signals. This is currently done
  ad-hoc. For now, this does not make any problems, or better, there
  is always the workaround that the user sets the signal handlers
  manually if any problems occur.

- The new cookie implementation of netcgi2 should replace the old
  one in netstring. Users should be prepared that Netcgi.Cookie
  will eventually become Nethttp.Cookie in one of the next releases.

- In netcgi2-plex, the "mount_dir" and "mount_at" options are not yet
  implemented.

- In netclient, aggressive caching of HTTP connections is still
  buggy. Do not use this option (by default, it is not enabled).

- The FTP client is still incomplete.
