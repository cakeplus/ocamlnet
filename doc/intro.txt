OcamlNet consists of several libraries:

- [netstring]
- [cgi]
- [nethttpd]
- [pop]
- [smtp]

In order to explore these libraries, it is recommended to read the
module {!Netchannels} first, as the object channels defined in this
module are a very basic structure, and used by most other modules.
There is also a {!Netchannels.tutorial}.

{2:netstring The [netstring] library}

[netstring] focuses on string processing functions.

{!modules: 
   Netconversion
   Netchannels
   Netstream
   Mimestring
   Netmime
   Netsendmail
   Neturl
   Netaddress
   Netbuffer
   Netdate
   Netencoding
   Netulex
   Netaccel
   Netaccel_link
   Nethtml
   Nethttp
   Netstring_str
   Netstring_pcre
   Netstring_mt
   Netmappings
   Netaux}

{2:cgi The [cgi] library}

This is the aged [cgi] library whose features are frozen. A description
of its interfaces can be found {{:cgi/index.html} here}.

Note that it is not possible to use [cgi] and [netcgi] at the same
time.


{2:netcgi The [netcgi] library}

This is the revised library for Web applications, now called [netcgi].

{!modules:
    Netcgi
    Netcgi_common
    Netcgi_cgi
    Netcgi_fcgi
    Netcgi_ajp
    Netcgi_scgi
    Netcgi_test
    Netcgi_mod
    Netcgi_modtpl
    Netcgi_dbi}

Note that it is not possible to use [cgi] and [netcgi] at the same
time.

{2:nethttpd The [nethttpd] library}

The [nethttpd] library is a Web server component written in O'Caml. 
For a full web server, you'll also need {!Intro.netplex}.

{!modules:
   Nethttpd_types
   Nethttpd_kernel
   Nethttpd_reactor
   Nethttpd_engine
   Nethttpd_services
   Nethttpd_plex}

{2:netplex The [netplex] library}

The [netplex] library is a protocol-independent server framework. 
Especially, it can be used in conjunction with {!Intro.nethttpd} to
build web servers, and with {!Intro.rpc} to build RPC servers.

{!modules:
    Netplex_types
    Netplex_config
    Netplex_controller
    Netplex_container
    Netplex_sockserv
    Netplex_workload
    Netplex_kit
    Netplex_log
    Netplex_main
    Netplex_mp
    Netplex_mt
    Rpc_netplex}

{2:equeue The [equeue] library}

[equeue] is a fundamental library for event queues. It is mainly used
by a number of other libraries of Ocamlnet to parallelize network code
(so-called multiplexing).

{!modules:
   Equeue
   Unixqueue
   Unixqueue_mt
   Uq_engines
   Uq_socks5}

{3:equeue_gtk The [equeue-gtk1] and [equeue-gtk2] extensions}

Extensions for [equeue] to integrate the event queue into user interfaces
made with lablgtk and lablgtk2

{!modules:
  Uq_gtk}

{3:equeue_ssl The [equeue-ssl] extension}

Extensions for [equeue] to support SSL

{!modules:
   Uq_ssl}

{3:equeue_tcl The [equeue-tcl] extension}

Extension for [equeue] to integrate the event queue into user interfaces
made with labltk

{!modules:
  Uq_tcl}

{2:pop The [pop] library}

This is a simple POP 3 client.

{!modules:
    Netpop}

{2:smtp The [smtp] library}

This is a simple SMTP client.

{!modules:
    Netsmtp}

{2:shell The [shell] library}

The [shell] library allows you to start external commands. It is integrated
into [equeue].

{!modules:
    Shell
    Shell_sys
    Shell_uq
    Shell_mt
    Unix_exts}
