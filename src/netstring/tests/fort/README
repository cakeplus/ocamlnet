FORT (Framework for Ocaml Regression Testing)
Copyright (c) 2001 Patrick Doane.
For conditions of distribution and use, see copyright notice in LICENSE.

FORT provides an environment for testing programs and Objective Caml
modules.  It contains a module that oversees the testing process as
well as a front-end for executing tests.  Individual test cases are
written as Objective Caml functions that return the result of
executing the test.  FORT was influenced by the design of DejaGNU [1]
and Greg [2] but there is no support for the cross-platform/remote
testing provided by DejaGNU nor is there a library which emulates the
behavior of the TCL expect library.

Usage of Fort is easy for unit testing pure Caml code. Simply pass the
library or compiled module along with the test script on the command
line like this:

  % fort unit_under_test.cmo test_script.ml

The file test_script.ml should contain a sequence of tests that invoke
the various functions of the Fort module See the interface file
fort.mli for documentation.
