About Netdns

Netdns is a library for doing asynchronous DNS lookups. It is not yet 
complete, but already usable as a so-called stub resolver (i.e. it 
needs a real DNS server in the LAN it can forward all requests to).

This version (0.1) is a pre-release. We know that this library is not
yet in the state it should be. Nevertheless, the stub resolver function
works and might be useful.

For the license conditions, see the file LICENSE.

Prerequisites

You need the following to build netdns:

- omake
- ocamlnet
- ocamlpcre

Build & Install

Build netdns by simply typing "omake".

There is currently no make rule to install this library. Regular
ocaml users will certainly know how to do that. 

How to use

See the program resolve.ml for an example (build with 
"omake resolve"). It accepts several host names on the command line
and resolves them in parallel. Note that you have to specify the
-server option to name the DNS server to which the requests are
to be directed.

Who developed this library

Netdns has been developed by Gerd Stolpmann <gerd@gerd-stolpmann.de>
as contract work for Wink Technologies (http://wink.com).
