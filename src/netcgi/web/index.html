      <h1>Netcgi</h1>

      Dynamic web applications are made of scripts/programs whose
      output is sent to the user.  These scripts need a connection
      with the web server in order to get the parameters and return
      the data.
      <a
      href="../doc/Netcgi.html"><span class="module">Netcgi</span></a>
      is a mature implementation of the following connectors:
      <ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/CGI/"
	       ><span class="desc">CGI/1.1</span></a>: The <i>Common
	       Gateway Interface</i> is a very simple connector but
	       suffers from performance problems as the script is
	       started from scratch for each request.  That also means
	       that the script cannot cache database connections which
	       are expensive to set up.  CGI is a good choice however
	       to test your scripts or for web sites that only need to
	       handle a few requests a second (it is supported by all
	       webservers).

	<li><a href="http://www.fastcgi.com/"
	       ><span class="desc">FastCGI</span></a>: FCGI scripts
	       can be either started by the web server or started "by
	       hand" possibly on a machine different from the web
	       server.  In both cases, the script is always running
	       (which allows caching), the web server connecting to it
	       for each request.

	<li><a
	       href="http://www.jajakarta.org/tomcat/tomcat-jk2/en/docs/common/AJPv13.html"
	       ><span class="desc">AJP&nbsp;1.3</span></a>: AJP is very
	       similar to FCGI except that the scripts (often
	       called <i>servlets</i> in this context in the Java
	       world) are usually started independently of the web
	       server.

	<li><a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/misc/API.html"
	       ><span class="desc">Apache API</span></a>: This
	  connector is a binding to the Apache API which works
	  with Apache 1.3 and Apache 2.* (although there are some
	  <a
	  href="http://merjis.com/developers/mod_caml/apache_2.0">issues</a>
	  with the latter).  This is a port from
	  <a
	  href="http://merjis.com/developers/mod_caml/">mod_caml</a>,
	  hence his name.  This connector is very fast.  However, your
	  scripts can only be compiled into bytecode (because they are
	  linked into the webserver at runtime with <tt>Dynlink</tt>)
	  and of course it only works with Apache.
      </ul>
