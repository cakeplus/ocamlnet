	* Nethttpd: Fixing a bug in Nethttpd_services that prevents in

	* Nethttpd: adding encap args in Nethttpd_plex.

2010-09-09  Gerd Stolpmann  <gerd@thinkpad.lan.sumadev.de>

	* Nethttpd: Nethttpd_plex.nethttpd_factory got new arg
	  processor_factory. This allows it to override this
	  factory. (Caveat: this factory must be polymorphic.)

	* Netsys: netsys_oothr.cma no longer contains a reference to
	  Thread. New archive netsys_oothr_mt.cma for this.

2007-05-06  Gerd Stolpmann  <gerd@gerd-stolpmann.de>

	* Fix: For Unix domain sockets, getsockname and getpeername
	  may return EAFNOSUPPORT. This code is generated by the
	  OCaml runtime when it sees an address it does not support.
	  We handle this case as a connected socket with inaccessible
	  address. The problem was reported to happen for MacOS.

	* Fix: IPv6 is now supported by most functionality. Exception
	  is the SOCKS stuff.

	* Fix netcgi2: Improving compatibility of Netcgi1_compat,
	  such that nethttpd works together with netcgi2. Porting
	  examples/nethttpd/netplex.ml to nethttpd+netcgi2.
