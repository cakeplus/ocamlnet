	* Fix: For Unix domain sockets, getsockname and getpeername
	  may return EAFNOSUPPORT. This code is generated by the
	  OCaml runtime when it sees an address it does not support.
	  We handle this case as a connected socket with inaccessible
	  address. The problem was reported to happen for MacOS.
