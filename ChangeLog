	* Preventing errors "Netchannels: Suppressed error in close_out:
  	  Netchannels.Closed_channel" (tentative fix)

2011-04-28  Gerd Stolpmann  <gerd@thinkpad.lan.sumadev.de>

	* Reverting Netencoding.Url to the implementation used

2011-03-07  Gerd Stolpmann  <gerd@thinkpad.lan.sumadev.de>

	  legacy module

	* Xdr, Xdr_mstring, Rtypes: have been moved to the "netstring"
	  library part

	  already no containers

	* Netplex_semaphore: added destroy. Some functions can now be
	  called from controller context.

	* Netplex config files: added support for config_tree. No
	  longer defaulting to /etc/netplex. Instead, the suffix ".conf"

2010-11-23  Gerd Stolpmann  <gerd@thinkpad.lan.sumadev.de>

	* Netcamlbox: it is now also possible to put messages with
	  int32,int64,nativeint and bigarrays into boxes

2010-10-01  Gerd Stolpmann  <gerd@thinkpad.lan.sumadev.de>

	* Nethttpd: Fixing a bug in Nethttpd_services that prevents in

	  processor_factory. This allows it to override this
	  factory. (Caveat: this factory must be polymorphic.)

	* Netsys: netsys_oothr.cma no longer contains a reference to
	  Thread. New archive netsys_oothr_mt.cma for this.

	* Netsys: resolving circular dep netsys <-> netsys_signal

2007-05-06  Gerd Stolpmann  <gerd@gerd-stolpmann.de>

	* Fix: For Unix domain sockets, getsockname and getpeername
	  may return EAFNOSUPPORT. This code is generated by the
	  OCaml runtime when it sees an address it does not support.
	  We handle this case as a connected socket with inaccessible
	  address. The problem was reported to happen for MacOS.

	* Fix: IPv6 is now supported by most functionality. Exception
	  is the SOCKS stuff.

	* Fix netcgi2: Improving compatibility of Netcgi1_compat,
	  such that nethttpd works together with netcgi2. Porting
	  examples/nethttpd/netplex.ml to nethttpd+netcgi2.
