To build the test bench with the non-installed ocamlnet, do:

make OCAMLRPCGEN=../../../src/rpc-generator/ocamlrpcgen OCAMLPATH=../../../src

To run it, do:

./prototest all

There are two additional tests:

./protoserver -non-responsive -conf proto.conf.1
./protoserver -cont-failure -conf proto.conf.1

The first one simulates a container that does not start up. You should see
attempts to restart it after 60 seconds (in the log file). The second test
simultaes a container that immediately crashes after start up. This container
is disabled.
